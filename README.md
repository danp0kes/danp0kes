    <td>Ever wanted to know how old you look based on a photo? In this project, I use TensorFlow to create a model that predicts your age within 6.1 years of your actual age. 
    
- How the model was developed 🛠️
- Its performance (the highs and the lows) 📊
- Real-world implications 🌎

One cool advantage is that it could eliminate the need for manual age verification for over half of all customers purchasing alcohol (that is when customers aren’t gaming the system of course).
